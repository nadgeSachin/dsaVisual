    <h1>Strings</h1>
    <p class="description">
      Strings are a fundamental data type used to represent sequences of characters. In most programming languages, strings are a sequence of characters enclosed within double quotes ("") or single quotes (''). A single character can also be considered a string with a length of one. Strings are ubiquitous in programming and play a crucial role in various applications, including text processing, data manipulation, and user interaction.

    <h2>Characteristics of Strings:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Immutable: In many programming languages, strings are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed after creation. Any modification to a string requires creating a new string with the desired changes.</li>
      <li>Indexing and Slicing: Strings support indexing, where individual characters can be accessed using their positions (indices). Additionally, strings can be sliced, allowing you to extract a portion of the string based on specified start and end indices.</li>
      <li>Concatenation: String concatenation is the process of combining two or more strings into a single string. This is a common operation used to build longer strings from smaller pieces.</li>
      <li>Length: The length of a string refers to the number of characters it contains. It is a crucial property as it determines the size of the string and aids in various string manipulation operations.</li>
      <li>Encoding: Strings can be represented using different character encodings, such as ASCII, UTF-8, and UTF-16, to support different character sets and internationalization.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>String Operations:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Concatenation: Concatenation of strings can be performed using the "+" operator in most programming languages. For example, str1 + str2 will create a new string that contains the contents of both str1 and str2.</li>
      <li>Substring: Extracting substrings is a common operation performed on strings. It can be achieved using slicing or dedicated substring methods.</li>
      <li>Searching: Finding the position of a substring within a larger string is essential in text processing. Functions like indexOf and find are commonly used for this purpose.</li>
      <li>Case Conversion: Strings can often be converted to uppercase or lowercase using built-in functions to achieve specific formatting.</li>
      <li>Splitting and Joining: Strings can be split into substrings based on specific delimiters, and multiple strings can be joined together using delimiters.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>String Manipulation:</h2>
    <p class="description">
      Strings are widely used in text processing tasks, such as parsing data, manipulating file contents, and handling user inputs. Common string manipulation techniques include parsing, replacing, formatting, trimming, and validation.
    </p>
    <h2>String Handling in Different Programming Languages:</h2>
    <p class="description">
      Each programming language provides its own set of libraries and functions to handle strings efficiently. For example, Python strings are immutable and offer extensive support for string manipulation, slicing, and formatting. Java strings are also immutable, and the Java String class provides various methods for string manipulation and comparison. C++ provides a powerful standard string library, which allows efficient string manipulation and supports concatenation and slicing.
